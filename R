The goal of this project is to create a linked-list for The Odin Project.

Important to note is that Ruby does not have built-in support
for linked lists; because of this, a class for lists and node objects will have
to be written, as well as any of the classic functions for 
adding, deleting, traversing and inserting nodes into the list.
